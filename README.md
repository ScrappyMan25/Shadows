## About

A top down 2D exploration/stealth Game. Game is set in complete darkness with yourself and enemies as light sources. If youre within an enemy ray you 
get detected and sent back.

#### Controls
* WASD/ Arrows/ D-Pad : 	Movement
* Tab :	Pick Player Color

#### Features
* Raycast Plus Hitbox to make light detection.
* Chekpoints and Door made Modularly to then be implemented into the game whenever needed.
* Easter Egg ending!

#### Personal Note
* As usual - Enjoyed Godot.
* Learnt more about myself as a game developer
* New found respect for Animators and Level Designers. Kudos to them.
* I have to say that i enjoyed making the mechanics a lot more than i did making a level to cohesively demonstrate all of that. But i hope i did it justice ^-^

#### Credit
Happy to say that this time around I made a lot of my own assets(Buttons and checkpoints)
